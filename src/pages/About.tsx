                    <h1>Project Deprecation Notice</h1>
                    <p>We regret to inform you that <i>ProjectPilot</i> is no longer actively maintained. This decision was not made lightly, and we want to share the reasons behind it as transparently as possible.</p>
                    <h1>Reason for Deprecation</h1>
                    <p>
                         <b>Conflict of Interest:</b> Within our development team, there emerged a significant conflict of interest regarding the future direction of <i>ProjectPilot</i>. Some developers believed in continuing and expanding the project to adapt to the evolving market needs, while others felt that our resources and efforts should be redirected to new initiatives. After extensive discussions and considerations, we reached an impasse that led us to decide to deprecate the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <b>Current Scenario:</b> The rapidly changing landscape of project management tools and the emergence of new technologies also played a role in our decision. We recognized that, to stay competitive, <i>ProjectPilot</i> would require substantial updates and innovations. However, given the division within the team, we concluded that it would be more prudent to halt further development.
                    </p>
